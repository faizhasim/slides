# Libraries that Promotes Functional

---

## [Underscore.JS](http://underscorejs.org/)

- Very clean API and source code.
- Older established framework and products uses this (eg Confluence).
- My recommendation: ★★★☆☆

---

## [Lo-Dash](https://lodash.com/)

- Very similar to Underscore.JS, except more performant.
- Roadmap: Lazy sequence/stream.
- Supports compatibility with Underscore API.
- My recommendation: ★★★★☆

---

## [Lazy.js](http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/)

- Just like underscore, but not compatible at all.
- Key feature: Lazy evaluation on collections or stream.
- My recommendation: ★★★★★

---

## [Allong.es](http://allong.es/)

- Facilitate using functions as first-class values.
- Fundementally build from `curry`-ing and partial applications.
- My recommendation: If you think you need it, use it.
